# Viro — build progress

Live checklist for the overnight build. Each milestone is committed and pushed.

Legend: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ planned

## Milestone 1 — Control-plane foundation ✅
- ✅ Monorepo scaffold, `.gitignore`, Makefile, MIT license, `.env.example`
- ✅ Go API skeleton (`apps/api`): config, structured logging, graceful shutdown
- ✅ HTTP router (chi) with health/readiness, version, CORS, request logging
- ✅ Typed **Coolify API client** (`internal/coolify`) — apps, deploy lifecycle, databases, envs
- ✅ App proxy endpoints (`/v1/apps`, `/v1/databases`) over Coolify
- ✅ Unit tests (Coolify client via httptest + HTTP handlers) — `go test ./...` green
- ✅ Coolify API reference extracted to `docs/COOLIFY_API.md`

## Milestone 2 — Identity, orgs & RBAC ✅
- ✅ Users, organizations, memberships, roles (member/admin/owner, rank-compared)
- ✅ JWT auth (access + refresh, HS256), bcrypt, signup/login/refresh/me
- ✅ Repository layer: `store.Store` interface + thread-safe in-memory impl (Postgres impl plugs into same interface)
- ✅ Auth middleware + `Authorize(min role)` org-scoped checks; unit tests green
- ✅ Folded in M1 judge fixes: prod JWT-secret guard, CORS-wildcard-vs-credentials, bounded upstream body read

## Milestone 3 — App lifecycle, tenant scoping & RBAC enforcement ✅
- ✅ **Fixed M2 judge P0**: resources are now org-scoped + role-authorized at the HTTP layer
- ✅ Tenant-scoped `App`/`Database` records (org-owned, linked to Coolify UUID)
- ✅ `platform` service: create/list/get/deploy/stop/restart/delete apps; create/list databases
  (works in demo mode with no Coolify; calls Coolify when configured)
- ✅ Routes nested under `/v1/orgs/{orgID}/...`; `orgAuthz(role)` middleware (member reads, admin mutates)
- ✅ HTTP + service tests: cross-tenant read → 403, cross-tenant resource → 404, member cannot mutate → 403
- ✅ Folded M2 judge P1: password max-length (72-byte) guard
- ⬜ Deployments history + live logs streaming (next pass)

## Milestone 4 — Databases, domains, metrics ⬜
- ⬜ Managed databases (Postgres/Redis/MySQL/Mongo) via Coolify
- ⬜ Custom domains + TLS; metrics + logs providers; unit tests

## Milestone 5 — Billing & usage (Stripe test-mode) ✅
- ✅ Plan catalog (Hobby/Launch/Scale, fly.io-style usage pricing), public `/v1/billing/plans`
- ✅ `PaymentProvider` interface: MockProvider (default/dev) + StripeProvider (HTTP, no SDK), feature-flagged
- ✅ Subscriptions + usage metering; org-scoped `/v1/orgs/{orgID}/billing` (member) + `/subscribe` (admin)
- ✅ Stripe webhook with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (timestamp tolerance)
- ✅ Unit tests: catalog, subscribe/usage/summary, signature verify (valid/tampered/wrong-secret), HTTP authz

## Milestone 6 — Web UI (fly.io look) ✅
- ✅ Next.js 15 (App Router, RSC) + Tailwind + fly.io theme (violet #7C3AED / near-black / mono)
- ✅ Balloon logo (violet→magenta gradient), marketing landing, login/signup
- ✅ Dashboard shell (sidebar + topbar), overview, apps list + app detail (Overview/Logs/Metrics/Env/Settings tabs)
- ✅ Databases, domains, metrics, settings (General/Team/Billing) pages
- ✅ Typed API client + AuthProvider; graceful mock fallback when API is down
- ✅ `npm run build` green (12 routes); vitest 17/17 passing
- ✅ Security: upgraded Next 15.1.6 → **15.5.19** (patched CVE-2025-66478)

## Milestone 7 — Local dev & DO deployment (prepared) ✅
- ✅ Dockerfiles (API: distroless static; Web: Next standalone) + full-stack `docker-compose.full.yml`
- ✅ Helm chart (`deploy/helm/viro`): api/web deployments+services, ingress, secret, values
- ✅ Terraform for DOKS (cluster, VPC, registry, managed Postgres) + `doctl` scripts (provision/build/deploy/teardown)
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI (Go vet/test/build + web install/test/build); `deploy/README.md`
- ⬜ (Live run deferred to tomorrow with your DO credentials — by design)

## Milestone 9 — Org → Project → App hierarchy & invitations ✅
- ✅ `Project` layer (every org auto-gets a `default` project); apps carry `projectId`
- ✅ Project memberships for fine-grained, project-scoped access
- ✅ Invitations: invite by email to an **org** (org role) or a **specific project** (project role),
  token-based accept (email must match), single-use; list + members endpoints
- ✅ `AuthorizeProject` — org admins/owners get all projects; project members scoped to theirs
- ✅ Routes: `/v1/orgs/{orgID}/projects[...]`, `/projects/{projectID}/apps`, `/members`,
  `/invitations`, and `/v1/invitations/accept`
- ✅ Tests: default project, admin-only project create, org invite→admin, project invite→scoped
  access (not org admin, no access to other projects), wrong-email + reuse rejected

## Milestone 10 — CI/CD ✅
- ✅ CI (`ci.yml`): Go vet/test(-race)/build + web install/test/build on every push/PR
- ✅ CD (`deploy.yml`): tag/manual → DOCR login → build+push API & web images → DOKS Helm rollout

## Milestone 8 — Verification (continuous) 🚧
- ✅ Judge agent after each milestone (M1 PASS, M2→P0 found+fixed, M3 PASS, web PASS)
- ✅ Deprecation audits (backend CLEAN; web flagged Next CVE → upgraded to 15.5.19)
- 🚧 Final end-to-end sweep + frontend build verification
